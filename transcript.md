**Alex:** Alright, thanks, everyone, for joining. Let’s keep this quick. The goal today is to check in on the project timeline, discuss any blockers, and align on next steps. Let's start with development. Jamie, where are we on the latest feature updates?

**Jamie:** So far, things are on track. The authentication flow is done, and we’re wrapping up the API integration. We hit a small issue with the OAuth provider yesterday, but I found a workaround, and we should be good by tomorrow.

**Alex:** That’s great to hear. Any risks that might cause delays?

**Jamie:** Not at the moment. If testing goes smoothly, we should be able to move forward as planned.

**Alex:** Sounds good. Taylor, how’s the UI for this looking?

**Taylor:** The UI updates are about 90% done. I sent over the final screens for review last night. The main thing left is refining the mobile responsiveness. I’ll need a day or two to polish that.

**Alex:** Understood. Jordan, does this align with your marketing plans?

**Jordan:** Mostly, yes. I’d like to preview the UI before launch so we can align messaging with the visuals.

**Taylor:** I’ll send you a walkthrough after this meeting.

**Jordan:** On the marketing side, we have the first round of content ready for social media and email campaigns. We need the finalized screenshots by Thursday to wrap up the landing page.

**Alex:** Okay, that means we need the UI done by Wednesday at the latest. Taylor, is that feasible?

**Taylor:** Yes, I’ll prioritize it and make sure you have everything by Wednesday morning.

**Alex:** Alright, let’s check in again on Thursday to make sure we’re still on track. Thanks, everyone!
